# ✈️ Air Passengers Forecasting using LSTM

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast monthly air passenger totals based on historical data from 1949 to 1960.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Air Passengers Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/airline-passengers.csv)
- **Description**: Contains monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960.

---

## 🧠 Model Used

- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network
- Libraries: TensorFlow / Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## 🚀 Steps in the Project

1. **Load and Visualize Dataset**
2. **Normalize the Data**
3. **Prepare Sequences for LSTM**
4. **Split Data into Train/Test**
5. **Build and Train LSTM Model**
6. **Make Predictions and Plot Results**

---

## 🖼 Output

The final plot compares **actual** vs **predicted** number of passengers, showing the model’s ability to capture time series trends.
